Hello and welcome to my github. This repository acts as my engineering portfolio. For a short form version of this ReadMe, please visit my resume in this repository.

I have images here to showcase some different projects I've designed / built / etc. I'd be happy to discuss everything here further.

## About Me

My name is Cassidy Exum, I graduated from Stony Brook University in 2020 with a degree in mechanical engineering and a minor in computer science. I sought out postgraduate studies by completing a bootcamp in data science and machine learning. I'm open to roles in both engineering and data science.

## Job Experience

### Design Resources

After graduation, I worked for a small design firm where we designed a range of items like injection molded parts, electrical cabinets, and medical devices. This role was primarily focused on rapid prototyping and CAD design. 

Skills Developed: 
* CAD Software: ProEngineer, Creo 4, Solidworks
* 3D Printing
* Injection Molded Part Design
* Fabrication Design 

### Pvilion Technologies

At Pvilion I'm the lead HV engineer. We are a solar fabric design company with an emphasis on portability. At Pvilion I have designed backup energy storage systems, the electrical enclosures that house the equipment, and portable solar kits. When I became the lead HV engineer, I took on all projects involving high-voltage battery systems. A few of my images above showcase the design of these projects.

I've been with Pvilion for over 2 years, during this time the company has grown by 2x employees and annual revenue, and I designed a portable power station for the US Embassy in Ukraine in a $1.7M project.

Skills Developed:
* CAD Software: Autodesk Inventor, AutoCAD, Inventor FEA
* Electrical Engineering
* Actuated Tent Design
* Solar Balance of Systems Design
* Backup Energy Storage System Design
* Agile/Scrum Framework
* Data Analysis
* Residential/Commercial Scale Solar

## Data Science Tech Stack

You can view a few of my data science projects in other repositories on my profile. Some examples are a time-series forcasting and analysis of power consumption data, a sentiment analysis of tech tweets, and an analysis of solar, battery storage, ECU runtime, and generator fuel consumption for Pvilion. I'm well versed in excel, but I prefer to do larger projects in Python.

Tech Stack:
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NLTK
* SKLearn
* Numpy
* Keras

## Hobbies

1. Chess - I'm a huge fan of the game, and I enjoy watching, studying, and playing. I began playing in 2021 and have rapidly climbed online. I'm currently rated above 2000 on chess.com which is in the 99.2 percentile. A great part about living in NYC is being able to play against strangers in the parks.
2. Korean Language - In 2023, I began studying Korean. I decided to learn it due to the people and interests in my life that intersected in Korean. It's been challenging, and I'm still only a beginner, but I plan to continue practicing and hopefully using my skills when I visit Korea.
